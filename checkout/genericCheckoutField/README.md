# Generic Checkout Field - B2B / D2C Commerce for LWR
This component was designed to allow a User to add a single field from either the WebCart or CartDeliveryGroup objects to the Commerce LWR Place Order process. 

The included unit tests use a custom field "Requested_Delivery_Date__c" on the WebCart object as an example. If you do dnot use that field you will need to modify the unit tests.
