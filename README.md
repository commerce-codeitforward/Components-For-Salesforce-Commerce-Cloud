# Salesforce-Commerce-Cloud-Components

Welcome to Salesforce Commerce Cloud Components! 
This repository is an open source, community driven, source of reference / sample components for Commerce Cloud on Core. (That is to say B2B and D2C Commerce)

These components are components intended to get you started quicker on any customization that is needed within Commerce Cloud. While each developer strives to build the most 'production' ready component as possible to contribute, you should make your own assessment of the components prod-readiness before using them. 
In most cases, you'll be able to hit the ground running with these components and make your own modifications as needed. 

NOTE: These components are designed only for the LWR version of checkout, not the previous Aura version (flow based checkout).

This repository is not intended to replace the great content that Salesforce already provides us, but as LWR is still new this space can be used to bring together community created content quicker in some areas.
